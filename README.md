# Minesweeper  

Requires: Python 3, numpy

Written by: jmanchuck, stanleyycheung

## Gameplay

Run main.py.

Change board arguments in ```main.py``` to customise number of cells and number of bombs. 
``` 
board = Board(n size, number of bombs) 
```

Left click to open a cell, right click to flag a cell and left click an already open cell to auto reveal neighbours when all its neighbours have been flagged.
